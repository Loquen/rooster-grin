# Rooster Grin Frontend Test - Loquen Jones

## Technologies:
- React (create-react-app) - Easy to use, components lend themselves to modular design, I could reuse code for the similar sections.
- HTML
- SCSS via node-sass - Sass allowed me to easily leverage css specificity and use variables and functions to speed up development and make the code DRYer. 
- Express (production server for Heroku)
- Heroku

## Struggles: 
- Next time I would start with mobile first, it would make the media queries a bit clearer.
- Because I did all the styles from scratch there was a lot of small tweaking of elements to get them to work correctly

## Favorite Parts:

- I enjoyed building out the hero section because I've always enjoyed the aesthetic of the big welcome banners.
- I also really liked building the carousel from scratch because it allowed me to learn more about the inner workings of such a powerful component instead of just using an existing one.
